      <h1>about eleanor</h1>
      <p><strong>Eleanor Mund is an actress, singer, and performer</strong> based in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. She is originally from
        Manchester, Connecticut, and typically resides there in the summers.</p>

      <p><strong>From a young age, Eleanor loved performing in whatever way she could.</strong> However, it was not until high school
        that she began working towards pursuing a career in the theatre industry, and her passion for the performing
        arts was reignited. Starting in high school, she began taking voice and dance lessons and took every opportunity
        to perform, from plays and musicals to her high school’s select choirs. She also worked on sharpening her
        instrumental abilities, taking guitar lessons since she was little, and joining her school’s audition-based big
        band as a rhythm guitarist her senior year.</p>

      <p><strong>In 2022, Eleanor took one of the biggest steps of her career</strong> and chose to follow her passion by earning a BFA
        in Musical Theatre at Messiah University in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Since arriving at school, Eleanor has
        not only broadened her performance knowledge but also her technical theatre knowledge, taking on publicity and
        board operator roles for various university productions. She has also had much success onstage, having been
        blessed with the opportunity to portray Annie Jump Cannon in Messiah’s production of Silent Sky during her first
        fall at school, and Meg Magrath in Crimes of the Heart this past February. She is excited to see where her years
        at Messiah will take her.</p>

      <p><strong>As for what’s coming up next for Eleanor</strong>, she will be participating in a rigorous theater internship program
        over the summer with Springville Center for the Arts in upstate New York. She looks forward to growing,
        learning, and sharpening her industry skills through this experience.</p>
